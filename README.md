# Sharing experiences with others
Hi everyone, my name is Rudra and I love STEM, science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Despite myself being a high school student here in Melbourne, Australia, I've had the opportunity to work with governments, ranging from my local government to the state government on some really cool projects to protect our environment and local ecosystems. I've also had the opportunity to work with universities on research on astronomy, being involved in several discoveries and publications.
